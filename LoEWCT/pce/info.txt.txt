Classes and stuff from the in development Puerto Castle Game Engine.

This is mostly just testing around some of the Engine's capatibilities in [LoEWCT] in the following areas:
	- Playback
	- File Managing
	- Performance
	- And more
	
There might be a lot of useless things, but I just want to use [LoEWCT] as my little starting point on the engine.
