## Legends of Equestria, Wapa Castle Team Edition

[LoEWCT] is a WCT's approach at improving tux3's [LoE Private Server](http://github.com/tux3/LoE-PrivateServer) with stuff like a user friendly control panel that lets you access everything, like the chat, server console, tools to moderate players, easy configuration instead of touching .ini files, and more!

First [LoEWCT] thread on PonyForums.net: <http://ponyforums.net/showthread.php?tid=87>

A new thread will be created when the first public release of the [LoEWCT] remake is done.

This repository is made because [LoEWCT] will be written from scratch (well not really, but I am going to clean up some stuff and organize while adding new things to it).

I know I could have forked this from tux3, but since this is going to be a huge change, Id rather have my own repository without affecting the original. I DO have a forked version, but it's just there to help the original creator a little.
