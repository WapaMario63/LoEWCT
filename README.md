## Legends of Equestria, Wapa Castle Team Edition

[LoEWCT] is a the WCT's approach at improving tux3's [LoE Private Server](http://github.com/tux3/LoE-PrivateServer) with stuff like a user friendly control panel that lets you access everything, like the chat, server console, tools to manage players, easy configuration instead of touching .ini fules, and more!

First [LoEWCT] thread on PonyForums.net: <http://ponyforums.net/showthread.php?tid=87>

A new thread will be created when the first public release of the [LoEWCT] remake is done.

This repository is made because [LoEWCT] will be written from scratch, using the existing code of course, but not all of it.

This is **NOT** a fork of tux3's repository because of how different it's going to be.
