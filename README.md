## Legends of Equestria, Wapa Castle Team Edition

_This LoEWCT remake repo, LoE Movie Maker and other [LoEWCT] servers are now discountinued. Please check out [LoEWCT2](https://github.com/WapaMario63/LoEWCT2). This repo may soon be deleted in favor of LoEWCT2, it is better if you contribute to that. Ff you are looking for the original LoEWCT, see [LoE Movie Maker](https://github.com/WapaMario63/LoE-Movie-Maker) as it is pretty much the same thing._

### Original info

[LoEWCT] is a WCT's approach at improving tux3's [LoE Private Server](http://github.com/tux3/LoE-PrivateServer) with stuff like a user friendly control panel that lets you access everything, like the chat, server console, tools to moderate players, easy configuration instead of touching .ini files, and more!

First [LoEWCT] thread on PonyForums.net: <http://ponyforums.net/showthread.php?tid=87> (Site now dead)

A new thread will be created when the first public release of the [LoEWCT] remake is done.

This repository is made because [LoEWCT] will be written from scratch (well not really, but I am going to clean up some stuff and organize while adding new things to it).

I know I could have forked this from tux3, but since this is going to be a huge change, Id rather have my own repository without affecting the original. I DO have a forked version, but it's just there to help the original creator a little.

## FAQ

### Is this just like the one from ponyforums.net?

Nope, that one was basicly what would happen if I were to fork mlkj's repository and add/change some stuff for the better. This one however takes all that old code that is messy to work with and is more compatible with the new system I wanted to make on the original [LoEWCT].

### What is the difference between mlkj's private server, lemoncest and the old [LoEWCT] with this new [LoEWCT]?

* For mlkj's we maintain the compatability with both Babscon14, Ohaycon and August14 builds working, and also an entire new GUI.
* For lemoncest, it's way too much of a big difference I believe, since his is coded in the native language LoE was made in, Mono C#, plus his code is not yet released to the public, so I can't say anything without knowing how his server works.
* On the other hand, the old [LoEWCT], it adds lots of features that were once planned to be added on that [LoEWCT], but couldn't. See features.
